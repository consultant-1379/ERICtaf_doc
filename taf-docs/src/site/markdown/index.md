# Introduction

This documentation is intended to give you all the necessary information you need to understand what the
Test Automation Framework (TAF) is, how it works, and how to use it.

This documentation is split into several sections. The introductory section covers the what, why and how to get started
with TAF, including the set up required and how to create your TAF project.

Further sections have detailed descriptions of TAF concepts and components, as well as handy How-To guides for
different TAF functionalities, and finally some examples.

If you are new to TAF, it is advised to read the introductory section of this documentation before you begin.
It should hopefully give you a good basic understanding of what TAF is about, how it is used and the features available.

The Test Automation Framework is a community based project. The core TAF product is developed and maintained by the
TAF team, but other teams are encouraged to share test code so that other teams can benefit.
