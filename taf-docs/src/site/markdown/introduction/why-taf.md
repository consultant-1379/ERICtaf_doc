# Why Use TAF

Now you know what TAF is on a high level, but you may still be wondering why you should use it?

The initial effort needed to create automated test cases is not small. However, once you have the testcases
and operators created, you will see all the real benefits that come with test automation. These include reliability,
reusability, repeatability, and cost saving amongst others.

The advantages that TAF brings are plentiful. The consistent approach to test case design enables easier maintenance
and competence sharing. TAF also has reusable components, a modular approach, with all the advantages that brings
including tool abstraction and traceability of testware.

TAF is written in Java, one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and one in which Ericsson has
plenty of competence.
