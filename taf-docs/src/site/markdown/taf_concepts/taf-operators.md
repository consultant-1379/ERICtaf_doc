# TAF Operators

There are several logical types of operators (in code they have no differences):

- REST operators
- UI operators
- CLI operators
- API operators

Operators could exist for each logical type. These operators have concrete implementation of SUT
business logic. Operators can be shared amongst teams and therefore should have business logic only.

For more information on operators you can look at the confluence page -
