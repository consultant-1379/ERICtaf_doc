# Data sources

**Data sources** are part of **Data-Driven Testing (DDT)** methodology.

**[Data-Driven testing](https://taf.seli.wh.rnd.internal.ericsson.com/userdocs/Latest/index.html#_data_driven_testing)** is creation of tests where test data and/or output values are read from data sources
instead of using the same hard-coded values each time the test runs.

## Benefits of Data-Driven testing

#### 1. Repeatability
Data-driven testing enables an approach where any test can be executed any number of times with different data each time.

#### 2. Maintainability
Depending on the context test case can be executed with different data set by seamlessly changing data provider.
Data sources can be used in different test cases which removes value duplication.
Re-use reduces maintainability costs.

#### 3. Increased coverage
Tests executed with different data each time cover more user cases. Thus are more realistic than test cases with hardcoded values.


**All these benefits can be gained by using TAF Data sources.**
