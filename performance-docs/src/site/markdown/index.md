# Introduction

**TAF Performance module** provides a convenient way to develop **performance** and **load tests**,
**execute** them against SUT and **analyze** the results, by bringing together a set of tools and providing integration between these instruments.

**Load testing** is usually defined as the process of exercising the system under test, by feeding it the largest tasks it can operate with until it reaches the threshold limit.
Load testing is sometimes called **volume testing**, or **endurance testing**.
The goals of load testing are to expose the defects in application related to *memory management* and *leaks*, *buffer overflow*, etc.
Another goal of load testing may be determining the upper limit of all the components of application like database, hardware and network.

**Performance testing** is the process of determining the speed or effectiveness of a computer, network, software program or device.
The goal of **performance testing** is not to find bugs, but to eliminate bottlenecks and establish a baseline for future regression testing.
To conduct performance testing is to engage in a carefully controlled process of measurement and analysis.

There are many tools to help perform load and performance testing, but often they do not provide a complete solution to the problem.

Example of integration can be automatic metric publication from tests to the analysis systems or dashboard integration with diagnostic data provider.
